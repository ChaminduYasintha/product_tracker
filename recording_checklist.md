# Video Recording Checklist

## Pre-Recording Setup

### Technical Setup
- [ ] Streamlit app is running and accessible
- [ ] Test URLs ready (have 2-3 different websites prepared)
- [ ] Browser DevTools ready to show CSS selector inspection
- [ ] Screen recording software configured (OBS, Camtasia, etc.)
- [ ] Microphone tested and audio levels checked
- [ ] Screen resolution set to 1920x1080 or higher

### Content Preparation
- [ ] Choose 2-3 demo websites with different price formats
- [ ] Pre-find CSS selectors for each demo site (to save time)
- [ ] Test the app with each URL to ensure it works
- [ ] Prepare example URLs:
  - surplus.lk product page
  - Alternative site (e.g., books.toscrape.com)
  - One more for variety

### App Testing
- [ ] Verify OpenAI API key is working
- [ ] Test with at least one URL to ensure no errors
- [ ] Check that timeout settings work (30 seconds)
- [ ] Ensure .env file is configured (if showing local setup)

## During Recording

### Opening Sequence

- [ ] Explain what the app does (30 seconds)

### Main Demo
- [ ] Paste first URL
- [ ] Show how to find CSS selector (inspect element)
- [ ] Paste CSS selector
- [ ] Click "Run Tracker"
- [ ] Wait for results (you can speed this up in editing)
- [ ] Show the structured output clearly
- [ ] Optionally show the raw JSON expander

### Optional: Second Example
- [ ] Show a different website to demonstrate versatility
- [ ] Highlight different currency or format

### Closing
- [ ] Summarize key benefits
- [ ] Call to action (subscribe, like, comment)

## Post-Recording

### Editing Tips
- [ ] Speed up spinner/waiting sections (2x speed)
- [ ] Add text overlays for key points
- [ ] Highlight important UI elements with arrows/circles
- [ ] Add background music (optional, keep it subtle)
- [ ] Add transitions between sections
- [ ] Include a thumbnail with app name

### Final Checks
- [ ] Audio is clear and consistent
- [ ] Screen is readable (not too zoomed in/out)
- [ ] No sensitive information visible (API keys, etc.)
- [ ] Video length is appropriate (3-5 minutes ideal)

## Example URLs & Selectors (Pre-test these!)

### surplus.lk
- URL: [Your test product URL]
- Selector: [Pre-found selector, e.g., ".price" or "#product-price"]

### books.toscrape.com (Backup)

- Selector: [Pre-found selector]

## Quick Tips
- **Practice the flow once** before recording
- **Speak clearly** and at a moderate pace
- **Pause briefly** when clicking buttons (for editing)
- **Show confidence** - even if something takes a moment to load
- **Keep it natural** - don't over-script your delivery
